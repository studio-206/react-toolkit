# Studio 206 - React Toolkit

This is our react toolkit, for all the very generic things that we end up repeating ourselves in most projects.

There's little-to-no styling to most of the components, it's more about underlying logic and to help us do tedious repetitive tasks a little faster.

## Components

- Form
- Scrim

## Hooks

- [`useWindowSize`](./src/hooks/useWindowSize.tsx)

## Installation

npm 

```bash
npm i @studio206/react-toolkit
```

Yarn

```
yarn add @studio206/react-toolkit
```
