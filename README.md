# Studio 206 - React Toolkit

This is our react toolkit, for all the very generic things that we end up repeating ourselves in most projects.

There's zero styling to most of these things, it's more about underlying logic and to help us do tedious repetitive tasks a little faster.

> Note: If you are using this with Next.js, you must use [next-transpile-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules). This is because we don't transpile these components, they're written and imported directly as `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
